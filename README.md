TASBID: A Training and Assessment System for Bridge Inspection with a Drone
TASBID is a bridge inspection simulation developped in Unity. The inspection can be done by keyborad or a hand controller. 
In-task feedback will be proved during the inspection.
Post-task feedback will be assessed by the collected inspection data. 

# Package   

## Unity:  
The unitypackage including the Unity files. Download this package and improt in Unity to start this simulation
    
### How to use  
Manual can be found in doc file of "TASBID Manual".

### Note
Assests adoptted in this Unity game including:  
(1) Road Architect, free, can be downloaded from: https://github.com/MicroGSD/RoadArchitect  
(2) traffic simulation, free, can be downloaded from: https://github.com/mchrbn/unity-traffic-simulation  
(3) Unity drone controller asset, can be purchased from: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/physics/drone-controller-full-pc-joystick-mobile-111163 
    Related original codes of this drone asset have been hided. Please make sure you purchase this asset from Unity before run this inspection.
